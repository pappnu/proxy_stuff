# Proxy stuff

A plugin for additional [Proxyshop](https://github.com/Investigamer/Proxyshop) templates.

## Templates
- Borderless Showcase
- Borderless Vertical
- Vectorized Borderless Planeswalker

## Requirements

A version of [Proxyshop](https://github.com/Investigamer/Proxyshop) that matches it's main-branch and has all of my pull requests merged to it (not all of them are vital, but this is the setup I test my plugin with). There's an [unofficial build](https://github.com/alex-taxiera/Proxyshop/releases) available that should fulfill this criteria.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Proxyshop installation's plugins folder.
    ```sh
    cd "/path/to/your/MTG-Proxyshop/plugins"
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pappnu/proxy_stuff.git
    ```
    or download and extract the folder in [this archive](https://github.com/pappnu/proxy_stuff/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to your plugins folder. Rename the extracted folder as `proxy_stuff`.
2. Download the templates via Proxyshop's updater.
